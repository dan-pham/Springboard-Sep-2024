Part I

1. What git command creates a branch?

	git branch <branch-name>

2. What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

	A fast-forward merge occurs when the original branch has no new commits and the current branch has new commits, the latest commit pointer will move to the latest commit of the current branch when merged.
	A recursive merge occurs when both the original branch and the current branch have new commits. Git will reconcile the differences between the two branches and combine the changes from both.

3. What git command changes to another branch?

	it checkout <branch-name>

4. What git command deletes a branch?

	git branch -d <branch-name>

5. How do merge conflicts happen?

	Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two branches that are being merged. This typically happens when the same lines of code are modified in different ways and Git cannot determine which version to keep. In this case, you need to manually resolve the conflicts.



Part II



Fast-forward merge

echo "This is the initial content." > Main.txt 
git add Main.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with Main.txt"

git checkout -b fast-forward-merge
echo "New content." >> Main.txt
git add Main.txt
git commit -m "Add new content to Main.txt"

git checkout main
git merge fast-forward-merge



Recursive merge

git checkout -b conflict-branch
echo "Conflict change on conflict-branch" > Main.txt
git add Main.txt
git commit -m "Conflict change on conflict branch"

git checkout main
echo "Conflicting change on main branch" > Main.txt
git add Main.txt
git commit -m "Conflicting change on main branch"

git merge conflict-branch

Auto-merging Main.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Main.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

git add Main.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and conflict-branch"
